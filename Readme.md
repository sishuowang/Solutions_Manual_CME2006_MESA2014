This project provides a solutions manual for all excercises in the two influential books on statistical molecular evolution by Ziheng Yang: [<i>Computational Molecular Evolution</i>](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/CME/) (CME) [Yang 2006] and [<i>Molecular Evolution: A Statistical Approach</i>](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/MESA/) (MESA) [Yang 2014].

Authors: **Sishuo Wang**, **Jianhao Lv** (interestingly, Ziheng Yang and both authors are alumni of China Agricultural University)
* [Sishuo Wang](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/med/mic/People/Sishuo.html) is from Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.
* [Jianhao Lv](https://sxy.nfu.edu.cn/xygk/szdw/szql/zj/c9cea5751f3c448585440f7b5b4a46bc.htm ) is from Nanfang College, Guangzhou, China.

We hope the solutions manual plays a tiny role in helping people better understand Ziheng's books and appreciate phylogenetics from a statistics perspective.

The solutions manual has NOT been formally reviewed, because everyone is welcome to review it. So by no means are the solutions to be taken as a “standard answer”. **Instead, you are strongly encouraged to share your feedback and explore alternative solutions via this GitHub platform**. Your contributions are important to help foster a community-driven effort to assist anyone interested in delving deeper into molecular evolution.

# Notes
1. We aim to help biologists better understand computational molecular evolution by providing
   * very detailed step-by-step solutions
   * code as R as possible (as that's familiar to most biologists), from programming to calculus, linear algebra and statistical computation
   * where possible, alternative solutions and both analytical and simulation solutions.

2. The problems cover only **a tip of the iceberg of the original books** so it is always highly recommended to carefully read the original books.

3. Ziheng provided very insightful solututions to [four problems](https://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/CME/Yang2006CME.Exercises.pdf) of Yang 2006. For these problems, we try to provide different solutions where possible, as also indicated above.
  
4. This work has never received any fund. **If you find this github repository helpful, please consider ★ it.**

We are particularly grateful for **Ziheng** for roviding so many interesting problems in his books, and for his encouragement during the process we worked on the solutions. A list of people to acknowledge is included under the folder "Notes/". Those problems that specifically need help or validation are listed there, too.
