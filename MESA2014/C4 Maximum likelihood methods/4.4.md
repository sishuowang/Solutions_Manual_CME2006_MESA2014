**Solution.**

Recall Eq. (4.26) in (Yang 2014a), where the transition matrix is given as

$$P(0.2) = \begin{bmatrix}
0.811138 & 0.080114 & 0.082824 & 0.025924 \\
0.055240 & 0.836012 & 0.082824 & 0.025924 \\
0.055240 & 0.080114 & 0.838722 & 0.025924 \\
0.055240 & 0.080114 & 0.082824 & 0.781821
\end{bmatrix}.$$

Denote the ancestral node as node 0, such that its ancestral state is
expressed as $X_{0}$ which can take any of the four nucleotides, denoted
as $x_{0}$. The likelihoods that the ancestral nucleotide at the root is
T, C, A, G, respectively, are calculated as follows

$$L_{0}(T) = 0.082824 \times 0.082824 \times 0.025924,$$

$$L_{0}(C) = 0.082824 \times 0.082824 \times 0.025924,$$

$$L_{0}(A) = 0.838722 \times 0.838722 \times 0.025924,$$

$$L_{0}(G) = 0.082824 \times 0.082824 \times 0.781821.$$

According to the problem statement, the equilibrium frequencies of each
nucleotide are given as
$\pi_{T} = 0.2263,\ \pi_{C} = 0.3282,\ \pi_{A} = 0.3393,\ \pi_{G} = 0.1062.$
The posterior probability that the ancestral node (node 0) takes
character $x_{0}$ can be expressed as follows, according to Eq. (4.23)
of (Yang 2014a)

$$f\left( x_{0} \middle| x_{h};\theta \right) = \frac{\pi_{x_{0}}L_{0}\left( x_{0} \right)}{\sum_{x_{0} \in \left\{ T,C,A,G \right\}}^{}{\pi_{x_{0}}L_{0}\left( x_{0} \right)}}.$$

Hence, using the following R script, the posterior probabilities of the
ancestral nucleotide at the root for T, C, A, G are respectively
0.005870062, 0.008513276, 0.902538297, 0.083078366.


```R
> lik <- numeric(4)
# in the order T, C, A, G
> lik[1] <- 0.082824*0.082824*0.025924
> lik[2] <- 0.082824*0.082824*0.025924
> lik[3] <- 0.838722*0.838722*0.025924
> lik[4] <- 0.082824*0.082824*0.781821
> pi <- c(0.2263, 0.3282, 0.3393, 0.1062)
> result = pi * lik / sum(pi * lik)
> print(result)
```
